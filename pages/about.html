                <h1>About Procrastination</h1>
                <p>Procrastination is a common human behavior that affects many aspects of our lives. It is the act of delaying or postponing tasks, often to the point of causing discomfort and anxiety.</p>
                <p>Tim Urban, in his insightful article, explores the concept of procrastination and introduces the idea of the "Panic Monster." According to Urban, the Panic Monster is a mythical creature that awakens when a deadline is imminent, forcing us to complete the task at hand. The battle between the Instant Gratification Monkey and the Panic Monster represents the constant struggle we face in managing our time and productivity.</p>
                <p>Procrastination can have various impacts on our lives, including increased stress, missed opportunities, and compromised well-being. Understanding the root causes and developing strategies to overcome procrastination is crucial for personal and professional growth.</p>
